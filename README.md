# pdptools

* lst2deposit - creates a SIMH deposit file from a MACRO11 LST file
* pdpcom - allows to upload deposit file content to a serial attached PDP11 

# How to Build
See sub projects readme files,  [lst2deposit/README.md](lst2deposit/README.md) 
and [pdpcom/README.md](pdpcom/README.md)

# How to use
See sub projects readme files,  [lst2deposit/README.md](lst2deposit/README.md)
and [pdpcom/README.md](pdpcom/README.md)

# Example use cases
See directory [arthur-gill-examples](arthur-gill-examples) for examples I typed in from
Arthur Gills great book.

See [arthur-gill-examples/Makefile](arthur-gill-examples/Makefile) on how to use it.

Some other random examples are in [examples](examples).
